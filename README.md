## Introduction

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical aspect of deep learning, especially in deploying models for real-world applications. Deep learning models are trained on specific datasets and are often highly specialized in recognizing patterns within the distribution of their training data. However, when presented with inputs that fall outside this distribution, such as novel or anomalous data points, these models may produce unreliable predictions with high confidence, leading to catastrophic outcomes in sensitive domains like healthcare, autonomous driving, and financial systems. Therefore, the ability to accurately identify OOD samples ensures that the system remains robust and dependable by flagging cases that require additional human intervention or alternative processing strategies.

From an academic standpoint, OOD detection also addresses broader challenges in machine learning, such as enhancing generalization and mitigating overfitting. Robust detection mechanisms facilitate the safe deployment of models in dynamic environments where the data encountered can vary significantly from the training set. Furthermore, the integration of OOD detection frameworks allows researchers to explore the boundaries of a model's epistemic uncertainty, which is crucial for developing models with calibrated confidence levels. This not only promotes transparency and interpretability in machine learning systems but also aligns with the ethical imperative to mitigate potential risks associated with automation and decision-making in AI-driven technologies.

## Loss

```python
class LogitNormLoss(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, temperature: float = 1.0, margin: float = 0.1):
        super(LogitNormLoss, self).__init__()
        self.device = get_device()
        self.temperature = torch.nn.Parameter(
            torch.tensor(temperature, requires_grad=True)
        )
        self.margin = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(margin, requires_grad=True))

    def forward(self, x, target):
        norms = torch.norm(x, p=2, dim=-1, keepdim=True) + pow(10, -7)
        logit_norm = torch.div(x - self.margin, norms) / self.temperature
        return torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(logit_norm, target)
```
